This license gives you two options, depending on whether you want to use the material commercially.

## Option A: Noncommercial

You can use the material as long as you:

1. Give credit
	* In most cases, simply providing a link to the original is enough credit. (Specifically, the original has to include a link to this license, or you can include one yourself.)
2. Use the material for noncommercial purposes only
	* This license takes its definition of "noncommercial" from the Creative Commons licenses. Creative Commons has a page about its meaning [here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation). One thing in particular to note is that "noncommercial" describes the use, not the user: Both for-profit and non-profit entities can use the material for noncommercial purposes.

## Option B: Commercial

You can use the material for commercial (or noncommercial) purposes as long as you:

1. Give credit
	* In most cases, simply providing a link to the original is enough credit. (Specifically, the original has to include a link to this license, or you can include one yourself.)
2. Allow other people to use your own work that includes it, by using this license
	* You can also use a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (3.0 or later) or one of the [compatible licenses](https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses).

**Note**: You can choose this option even if you don't use the material for commercial purposes, in order to give others the possibility of commercial use.
