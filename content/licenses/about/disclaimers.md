I am not a lawyer and I cannot provide legal advice. Although I created these licenses for my own work, anyone can use these licenses, and any disputes about copyright or other similar rights must be settled with the owner of those rights.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the right to apply these licenses to your work or to use work that is available under these licenses. I disclaim any liability for damages that may result from using these licenses.
