You can use and share the material for noncommercial purposes, as long as you give credit.

In most cases, simply providing a link to the original is enough. (Specifically, the original has to include a link to this license, or you can include one yourself.)

This license takes its definition of "noncommercial" from the Creative Commons licenses. Creative Commons has a page about its meaning [here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation). One thing in particular to note is that "noncommercial" describes the use, not the user: Both for-profit and non-profit entities can use the material for noncommercial purposes.
